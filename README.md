### 1. Versioning

- It's better to have different versions for your api, and create different `routes`, `services`, and `controllers` for each version.

### 2. Name Resources in Plural

There are many different data formats but JSON (Javascript Object Notation) is a standardized format.

Although there's the term JavaScript in JSON, it's not tied to it specifically. You can also write your API with Java or Python that can handle JSON as well.

Because of its standardization, API's should accept and respond with data in JSON format.

### 4. Respond With Standard HTTP Error Codes
